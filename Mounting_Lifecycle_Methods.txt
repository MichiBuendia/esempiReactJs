Mounting Lifecycle Methods
There are three categories of lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting.
This lesson is about the first category: mounting lifecycle methods.

A component "mounts" when it renders for the first time.
This is when mounting lifecycle methods get called.

There are three mounting lifecycle methods:

componentWillMount
render
componentDidMount
When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in order.

componentWillMount
The first mounting lifecycle method is called componentWillMount.

When a component renders for the first time, componentWillMount gets called right before render.

render
render is a lifecycle method!

You should understand how render fits into the mounting period.
Whenever a component mounts, componentWillMount is called first, followed by render, followed by componentDidMount.

render belongs to two categories: mounting lifecycle methods, and updating lifecycle methods.

componentDidMount
The final mounting lifecycle method is called componentDidMount.

When a component renders for the first time, componentDidMount gets called right after the HTML from render has finished loading. Look in the code editor for an example of componentDidMount.

componentDidMount gets used a lot!

If your React app uses AJAX to fetch initial data from an API, then componentDidMount is the place to make that AJAX call.
More generally, componentDidMount is a good place to connect a React app to external applications, such as web APIs or JavaScript frameworks.
componentDidMount is also the place to set timers using setTimeout or setInterval.
